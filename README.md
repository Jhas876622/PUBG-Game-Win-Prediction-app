# -PUBG-Game-Outcome-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the final outcome of a PUBG match using machine learning. Winning requires a mix of strategy, game awareness, weapon usage, position control, and player skill. By analyzing in-game statistics and player behavior, machine learning models can learn meaningful patterns that correlate strongly with match performance.
